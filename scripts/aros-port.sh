# Stage one upstream AROS commit onto this tree - three-way, without committing.
#
# This tree was extracted from AROS rom/usb with rewritten history, so an upstream
# commit cannot be cherry-picked: it is not in this repository and its paths differ.
# This script does the equivalent across repositories.  It takes the commit's changes
# from an AROS clone, maps the paths, and applies them with a three-way merge onto our
# (de-AROS'd) files.  The result is left STAGED; nothing is committed.  The proposed
# commit message and the `git commit` line carrying the upstream author and date are
# written out for whoever commits.  CONTRIBUTING.md ("Tracking AROS upstream") has the
# conventions this implements.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/aros-port.sh [--partial] <aros-clone> <sha> [<upstream-path> ...]
#
#   <aros-clone>     a clone of https://github.com/aros-development-team/AROS (a
#                    blobless/shallow one is fine as long as it holds <sha> and its parent)
#   <sha>            the upstream commit
#   <upstream-path>  restrict the port to these upstream paths (e.g.
#                    rom/usb/classes/hub); default is everything under rom/usb
#   --partial        mark the trailer "(partial)": only part of the upstream commit
#                    is being taken in this commit
#
# Exit status: 0 = applied cleanly, 1 = applied with conflicts or failures (conflict
# markers in the tree; resolve and `git add`), 2 = nothing applied / usage error.
