"""Link the ROM-resident part of the USB stack into a custom 2 MB Kickstart image, so
USB comes up before strap picks a boot volume: mouse and keyboard in the early boot
menu, and booting from a USB or NVMe drive.

This is an advanced, entirely optional path. It does not replace, and does not touch,
the normal filesystem installation - see ROM-ReadMe.md.

The seven Poseidon ROM modules are found automatically - from the archive this script
ships in (the ROM/ drawer of Poseidon-<ver>-<cpu>.lha, beside LIBS/ and Classes/), or
from the build tree when run out of a source checkout. Anything else is passed on the
command line, so this stays driver-agnostic: on PiStorm/Emu68 that is normally
bcmpcie.library + xhci.device, plus nvme.device if you want to boot from NVMe.

Every module has to be ROM-clean - no writable data at all, because the image is mapped
read-only and writes to it vanish silently.

Prerequisites: romtool from amitools (pipx install amitools), and your own stock
512 KiB AmigaOS 3.2 Kickstart.

# --- the image -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Emu68 maps a 2 MB Kickstart in four 512 KiB chunks: chunk 0 -> $E00000, chunk 1 ->
# $A80000, chunk 2 -> $B00000 (1 and 2 being one contiguous megabyte), and chunk 3 ->
# $F80000. $F00000 is not mapped. So the image is:
#
#     [ 512 KiB bank @ $E00000 ][ 1 MB bank @ $A80000 ][ Kickstart @ $F80000 ]
#
# Both banks hold modules. The megabyte is filled first; the 512 KiB bank takes what
# does not fit there.
#
# Chunk 0 has one more job. Emu68 starts the m68k from the SSP and PC at addresses 0
# and 4, and while OVL is set - which it is at reset - it answers the first 512 KiB of
# the address space from chunk 0, not from $F80000. So chunk 0 has to begin with a reset
# vector, and the header romtool puts on an extension ROM is one: its second long is
# $F80002, the Kickstart's own JMP to its entry point. Exec switches OVL off before it
# reads anything in low memory, so those eight bytes are all that is ever fetched this
# way and the rest of the chunk is free. The header is why that bank is built even when

# it, which is where the Emu68 module window (devicetree.resource, gic400.library,
# mailbox.resource, 68040.library) actually comes up. "diag init" (105) only relocates
# diag areas - it initialises nothing - so the whole ROM set has to sit *below* -40.
