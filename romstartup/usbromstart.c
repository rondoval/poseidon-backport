/*
 * usbromstart.c — the Poseidon Kickstart-ROM startup resident.
 *
 * A plain NT_TASK RTF_COLDSTART resident with no library of its own: exec calls
 * rt_Init once during the coldstart chain and that is the module's whole life.  It
 * exists so a Kickstart image can bring the USB stack up before strap picks a boot
 * volume — see docs/rom-image.md.  It brings up the whole stack:
 * hub/hubss/massstorage plus the input classes, a device
 * unit, one class scan, and then the boot gate below.
 *
 * Ported from the AROS originals (rom/usb/usbromearlystartup.c and
 * usbromlatestartup.c).
 *
 * The whole ROM set has to live in the -41..-49 window, because the Emu68 module
 * window — devicetree.resource, gic400.library, mailbox.resource, 68040.library
 * — is not initialised by "diag init" (105, which only relocates diag areas) but by
 * `romboot` at -40, which binds the Emu68 board's diag romtag.
 * Below us: the boot menu (-50), which lists the boot volumes this resident waits for,
 * and strap (-60). Within the window we are after the classes we ask for (-45)
 * and after the HCD (-42).

 *   - every hub done with its port pass, because a hub in its power-good wait,
